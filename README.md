# Django Admin Microservice
This is the first of the three microservices that make up a Product section of an e-commerce app.
## Tech Stack
In this part of the project I used:
1. Django Framework
2. Django Rest Framework
3. MySQL
4. Docker
## How to Run
To run the project on your local computer follow the steps:
1. Install Python3
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv`
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the docker container: `docker-compose up`
